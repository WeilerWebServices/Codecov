In order to receive Docker Hub notifications, you will need to configure [webhooks](http://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/#webhooks) on Docker Hub:

1. Go to your repository on [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/)
2. Click on "Webhooks" in the "Settings" sidebar
3. Click "Add Webhook"
4. Enter a short name (e.g. "Gitter") and your Gitter webhook URL
