#### Empower developers with tools to improve code quality and testing.

---

#### Here are the things you'll need or want to have in place before using Codecov:

1.  An account on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket. Codecov relies on Git-based codehosts to run.

2.  Code coverage report(s) being generated by your test suite inÂ [the applicable programming language](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/supported-languages). Codecov ingests these reports to provide our product. The centrally supported code coverage report format is aÂ `.xml`Â format.

3.  [Really nice to have] AÂ [continuous integration provider](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/supported-ci-providers). This will automatically run tests, generate coverage and upload that coverage to Codecov for every commit.

[Getting Started](https://docs.codecov.io/docs#getting-started)

### [Basic Usage](https://docs.codecov.io/docs#basic-usage)

1.  Sign up on codecov.io and link either your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account.

2.  Once linked, Codecov will automatically sync all the repositories to which you have access.

3.  You can click on an organization from your dashboard to access its repositories, or navigate directly to a specific repository using:Â `https://codecov.io/<repo-provider>/<account-name>/<repo-name>`. Example:Â <https://codecov.io/gh/scrapy/scrapy>.

**A repository that has no coverage reports uploaded to codecov. Note that the repository upload token is displayed here.**

1.  Run your normal test suite to generate code coverage reports inÂ `.xml`Â format, likely through a CI build process.

2.  Use theÂ [Codecov bash uploader](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/about-the-codecov-bash-uploader)Â and a repository upload token, to upload your coverage report(s) to Codecov.

3.  Navigate back to the repository on Codecov, and you should see coverage information.

4.  If you are usingÂ `GitHub`, we recommend installing ourÂ [GitHub App Integration](https://github.com/apps/codecov). If not,Â [add a Team Bot](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/team-bot)Â so codecov can push notifications and properly interact with repository providers.

> Codecov has a number of framework/language specific implementations for uploading coverage reports. You can access many of these from our list ofÂ [Supported Languages](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/supported-languages)

### [Advanced Usage](https://docs.codecov.io/docs#advanced-usage)

1.  Check out ourÂ [recipe list](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/common-recipe-list)Â for common configuration questions.

2.  Get codecovÂ [comments on your Pull Requests](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/pull-request-comments): (GitLab/Bitbucket) use aÂ [Team Bot](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/team-bot), (GitHub) use theÂ [codecov GitHub integration](https://github.com/apps/codecov).

3.  Enforce relative or absolute targets and thresholds during your CI build using theÂ [Codecov YAML](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-yaml)

4.  UseÂ [flags](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/flags)Â to categorize reports in a single repository. This is great for monorepos or projects that include different types of test coverage (e.g., unit, end to end, integration).

5.  Use codecov with the[Â Sourcegraph Browser Extension](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/browser-extension). Note that on-premises versions of repository providers (e.g. GitHub Enterprise) are currently not supported with the Codecov Sourcegraph Browser Extension.
